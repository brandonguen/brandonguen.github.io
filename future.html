					<p style="text-align:center"> for my future plans after graduation I was the authority of management but I was want to be apart in the planning stages of a business. I am quite good at making plans and figuring my way out of situations. I want to carry these skills over with me into the real world and try to ame some money off of it. I am optimistic about my goals and hopefully will succeed!  </p>
